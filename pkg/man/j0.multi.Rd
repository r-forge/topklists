\title{
Function returning an overall point j0 of degeneration into noise for multiple ranked lists
}
\description{
Moderate deviation-based calculation of an overall point j0 of degeneration into noise for multiple ranked lists. The function takes a matrix of ordered lists and estimates a j0 for each pair of the input lists (columns), with repect to the preselected distance parameter \eqn{\delta}. This function combines the functions \code{compute.stream} and \code{prepare.Idata}.
}
\usage{
j0.multi(lists, d, v)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{lists}{
Input data frame, where each column represents one list of ordered items
}
  \item{d}{
The maximal distance of an object's rank positions when two lists are compared. When the distance between the respective rank positions of the object is smaller or equal \code{d}, then the object is assigned the value 1, otherwise 0
}
  \item{v}{
Parameter for estimating j0
}
}
\details{
The smaller \code{d}, the stronger the assumption about the concordance of any two lists (\code{d=0} is assuming identical rankings of an object)
}
\value{
A list containing the maximal estimated indices of information degradation j0 through all combinations of \emph{L} lists:
\item{maxK}{Maximal estimated k through all combinations of two lists}
\item{L}{Data frame of estimated j0 for each pairwise comparison}
\item{Idata}{Data stream vector of zeros and ones}
