\title{
Markov chain based rank aggregation
}
\description{
Aggregating ranked lists using three  Markov chain algorithms.
}
\usage{
MC(input, space = NULL, k = NULL, a = 0.15, delta = 10^-15)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{input}{
A list containing individual ranked lists.
}
  \item{space}{
A list containing the underlying spaces. If not explicitly specified, all lists are treated as coming from a common space defined by the union of all input lists.
}
  \item{k}{
An integer specifying the number of items in the output top-k list.
}
  \item{a}{
Tuning parameter to make sure Markov chain with the transition matrix is ergodic;
default set to 0.15.
}
  \item{delta}{
Convergence criterion for stationary distribution; default set to 10^-15.
}
}
\details{
Constructs ergodic Markov chain based on ranking data from individual lists. A larger probability in the stationary distribution corresponds to a higher rank of the corresponding element. The algorithm are considered: MC1 (spam sensitive), MC2 (majority rule), and MC3 (proportional).
}
\value{
A list of elements, two for each of the MC algorithms: 
\item{MC1.TopK}{A vector of aggregate ranked elements based on MC1 algorithm.}
\item{MC1.Prob}{Stationary probability distribution: a vector of probabilities corresponding to the ranked elements in MC1.TopK}
\item{MC2.TopK}{A vector of aggregate ranked elements based on MC2 algorithm.}
\item{MC2.Prob}{Stationary probability distribution: a vector of probabilities corresponding to the ranked elements in MC2.TopK}
\item{MC3.TopK}{A vector of aggregate ranked elements based on MC3 algorithm.}
\item{MC3.Prob}{Stationary probability distribution: a vector of probabilities corresponding to the ranked elements in MC3.TopK}
