\title{
Plot of the ordered stationary probabilities
}
\description{
Plot of the ordered stationary probabilities versus ranking contains useful information
regarding the relative rankings of elements. 
}
\usage{

plotMC(outMC, K, xlab="Ranking", ylab="MC Stationary Probability", main="")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{outMC}{
Output (a list) from running the MC algorithm 
}
  \item{K}{
Number of stationary probabilities to be plotted. If missing, all stationary probabilities contained in the MC output will be plotted
}
  \item{xlab}{
Text for x-label
}
  \item{ylab}{
Text for y-label
}
  \item{main}{
Text for title of plot, if desire
}
}
\value{
A plot of ordered stationary probabilities versus ranking.
